# 🏡 ALX Listing App

A modern and responsive listing application inspired by Airbnb — built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **ESLint**.  
This project serves as a learning exercise and practical implementation for building a full-stack, scalable listing platform with clean code architecture.

## 📋 Project Goal

The goal of the ALX Listing App is to simulate an **Airbnb-style listing page** where users can view various property listings. The project focuses on front-end layout, responsive UI, component reusability, and maintainable TypeScript code.
